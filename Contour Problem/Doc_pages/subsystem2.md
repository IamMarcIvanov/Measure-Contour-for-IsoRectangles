@page subsystem2 Issues in Coding


1. The paper was written in 1984. During that time, programming languages were not very developed. Thus, the algorithms were written in a language that is neither very close to that of computer languages nor entirely that of mathematics. This led to problems in interpretations at various locations. 


2. The top down approach of the paper was a little difficult to understand.


3. The program had to be written in c++. Despite the fact that the language is a powerful language there are a large number of deficiencies like the use of pointers and ineffective error reporting. This led to a number of small errors that took a disproportionately large amount of time to solve. 


4. The intervals, unions and differences specified in the paper could be interpreted in a number of ways which required us to spend a large amount of time just trying to find out the appropriate interpretation.
