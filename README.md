# Measure-Contour-for-IsoRectangles
This is part of Design and Analysis of Algorithms Course

It is an implemetation of Guting's 1984 paper: Optimal Divide-and-Conquer to Compute Measure and Contour for a Set of Iso-Rectangles

Iso-Rectangles are rectangles whose edges are parallel to the axes.
Measure means the area of the rectangles and Contour means the the boundary between the free and covered area of the plane. In general, it is a sequence of alternating horizontal and vertical line segments.

The files above also include the documentation of the code generated by using Doxygen.
